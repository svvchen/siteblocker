# siteblocker
Mini-project to get me to learn French (yes it's roundabout). **Goal:** block social media sites until I've reached my Duolingo french XP goal for the day.

**To Do:**
* Create add_site/remove_site methods.
  * Only available upon hitting daily xp. :)

**In Progress:**
* Create function to check on my Duolingo xp progress via their API endpoints.

**Done:**
* Created a `check_block` function that blocks websites based on the hosts file (let the pain begin).
* Create a blocker class that houses `check_block` and associated methods.
