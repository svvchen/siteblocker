# siteblocker
Mini-project to get me to learn French (yes it's roundabout). Goal: block social media sites until I've reached my Duolingo french XP goal for the day.

**To Do:**
* Create an add_site function.
* Aggregate similar functions into classes.

**In Progress:**
* Create functions to check on my Duolingo xp progress via their API endpoints.

**Done:**
* Created a check_block function that blocks websites based on the hosts file (let the pain begin).
